## ðŸ“š Overview
This repository contains two implementations of a 4WD Robot system using the STM32F407VG microcontroller: one using **bare-metal programming (direct register access)** and another using the **STM32 HAL** framework.

The system includes modular sensor acquisition and cloud connectivity:
- **Sensor data** is acquired using the **ADC in DMA mode** for efficient analog signal sampling.
- **Temperature readings** are obtained via **I2C communication** from a **DS1621** digital temperature sensor.
- **Wi-Fi communication** is handled by an **ESP8266 module**, enabling **cloud upload (ThingSpeak)** and **web-based monitoring**.

- **Microcontroller Board:** STM32F407VG Discovery  
- **Development Approach:** Hybrid  
  - **Bare-Metal Version:** Complete implementation (BLE control, cloud and local web server communication)  
  - **HAL Version:** Focused on cloud communication and monitoring interface (BLE control not included)
- **Features:**
  - Motor control via PWM
  - Sensor data acquisition
  - Wi-Fi communication with ESP8266
  - Cloud data upload (ThingSpeak)
  - Web-based monitoring interface

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure
- `src/` â€“ Source code  
- `inc/` â€“ Header files  
- `images/` â€“ Diagrams and architecture images  

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- The original **bare-metal version** includes full robot control (including BLE commands such as forward, backward, etc.), and supports both cloud and local web server communication.  
- The **HAL version** reuses parts of the original structure, focusing on cloud upload and monitoring, but **does not include** BLE-based robot command control.
